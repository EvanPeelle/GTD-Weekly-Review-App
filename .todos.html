//////////////////
Learnings:
Optimize performance Js.
Cache objects that are repeatedly called.(store the obj being called as a var, then call that var instead.)
Cache scripts using <script tags>
'this' is like a ; an antecedent, that changes the subject into the Obj that calls it. Left of the dot at call time. 
.Apply() can be used by another object, to borrow another method, and correctly adapt this to itself.
Closure - an inner scope that continues to have access to an outer scopes variables(ongoing)



////////////////////////////////
DONE!
- send data from web to graph table in docs
- host site
change shift to re-mapped command
create a graphing ability for focus projects: graph - simple...(doc hook?)
connect in db relationship from action to vision... (how would that be created?)
//weekly review:
- downward flow of items
- edit and add previous
- move each to any other level
- move to next
- make new pod from proj

- understanding of server side func calls
- understanding framework for server side code

1 - cultivate next action in one place

develop visualization for:
- monthly productivity
- daily productivity
- progress

how do i host all pages correctly?
- divide pages - to be s/m - doing - weekly review + checlist

/context/filt [ ]*
/track progss [+]
